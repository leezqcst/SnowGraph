# [](#header-1)Background

A software project usually has lots of various software engineering data, such as source code, documentation, bug reports, mailing lists, user forums, etc.
These software engineering data contain rich software-specific knowledge that can be leveraged to help software developers reuse the software project.
However, it is a difficult task for software developers to obtain knowledge from large-scale software engineering data for two reasons:

* Software engineering data are usually multi-source and heterogeneous. The problem of information island arises, and we don't know relationships between them.
* Natural language text is a common form of knowledge representation in software engineering data, while the machine comprehension of natural language text is very difficult.

# [](#header-1)Introduction

SnowGraph (Software Knowledge Graph) is a project for creating software-specific question-answering bot.
Given a software project and various software engineering data of it, you can use SnowGraph to:

* **Creating a software-specific knowledge graph automatically.** SnowGraph will extract entities from software engineering data, analyze relationships between them, and fuse them into a uniform graph database. Software developers can access the software-specific knowledge graph through graphic user interface or graph query language.
* **Creating a software-specific question answering bot automatically.** Given a natural language user question about the software project, the QA bot can return passages from software engineering data to answer the question.
