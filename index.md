# [](#header-1)Why We Research & Develop SnowGraph?

A software project usually has lots of various software engineering data, such as source code, documentation, bug reports, mailing lists, user forums, etc.
These software engineering data contain rich software-specific knowledge that can be leveraged to help software developers reuse the software project.
However, it is a difficult task for software developers to obtain knowledge from large-scale software engineering data for two reasons:

* Software engineering data are usually multi-source and heterogeneous. The problem of information island arises, and we don't know relationships between them.
* Natural language text is a common form of knowledge representation in software engineering data, while the machine comprehension of natural language text is very difficult.
